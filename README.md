# JavaScript Piano Application

## Overview
This project is a JavaScript-driven piano application that provides an interactive virtual piano keyboard with information about scales, fingerings, and notes for 28 different scales in all keys. The application utilizes VexFlow JS for handling musical notes.  The hope is to host this on my portfolio website as a free resource for people looking to learn piano scales. 

## Features
1. **Interactive Keyboard:** Users can change what key and scale is displayed on the virtual piano keyboard.
2. **Scale Information:** The application displays information about scales, fingerings, and notes.
3. **VexFlow Integration:** VexFlow JS is used to accomplish musical note rendering.

## Scales Included
The application supports the following 28 scales, each providing a unique musical flavor:

1. **Major Scale:** The fundamental and widely used scale, known for its bright and happy sound.
2. **Natural Minor Scale:** A common scale with a more somber and melancholic feel than the major scale.
3. **Harmonic Minor Scale:** Features a distinctive minor scale with a raised seventh degree, creating tension and intensity.
4. **Melodic Minor Scale:** Alters the sixth and seventh degrees when ascending, creating a unique sound.

6. **Phrygian Mode:** A minor scale with a lowered second degree, offering a mysterious and exotic vibe.
7. **Lydian Mode:** A major scale with a raised fourth degree, producing a dreamy and ethereal quality.
8. **Mixolydian Mode:** Similar to the major scale but with a lowered seventh degree, creating a bluesy sound.
